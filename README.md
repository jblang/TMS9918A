# rc9918

This is a TMS9918A-based video card for the RC2014. It allows the RC2014 to produce NTSC composite graphics using a classic chip of the 1980s. The TMS9918A was used in the TI-99/4A, MSX, ColecoVision, original Sega SG-1000. Enhanced derivatives were used in later MSX computers, the Sega Master System, and the Sega Genesis. The chip's designer claims it also influenced the architecture of the PPU in the Nintendo Entertainment System. 

This board is based on a [circuit](https://retrobrewcomputers.org/n8vem-pbwiki-archive/0/35845334/48860720/33053543/SRAM%20Replacement%20for%20TMS99x8%20VRAM.pdf) described by Tom LeMense for interfacing the TMS9918A with SRAM.  I started with his schematics, added port address decoding and laid out the circuit on an RC2014 module.

This board can be configured to use the same ports as the MSX, so it's possible to run some MSX software on it unmodified. I have successfully gotten the Bold demo to run. The graphics from other programs should work as well, but other parts of the MSX, such as I/O may need additional hardware to work.

The board has been built and tested using the gerber files generated from this project. The gerber files are available for direct download below, and the project has also been shared on OSH Park.

## Bill of Materials 

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| PCB | rc9918 PCB ([OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/projects/KfwMvnwH) - [Gerbers](https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1590576805094688/tms9918a_gerber.zip)) |
| U1 | 74HCT32 Quad OR gate |
| U2 | 74HCT138 |
| U3 | TMS9918A chip. Available on ebay. The TMS9918 without the A is missing a graphics mode. |
| U4 | 74HCT04 Hex Inverter |
| U5, U6, U7 | 74HCT574 Octal Flip-Flops |
| U8 | AS6C62256-55PCN or compatible 32KB SRAM.  I have put two footprints so either a wide or narrow DIP-28 will work as long as the pin-out is the same. I have also tested the circuit with a UM61M256K-15 32K SRAM salvaged off of an old Pentium motherboard where it was used for cache. |
| R1 | 75 ohm resistor |
| R2 | 0 ohm resistors. Wire jumper can be used in place of 0 ohm resistor. |
| R3 | 470 ohm resistor |
| L1 | FBA04HA600VB-00 ferrite bead. I got a message from Mouser that it is end of life now.  Other ferrite beads should work fine. The closer in size to the footprint of a 1/4W resistor, the better it will fit. |
| Y1 | LFXTAL029962REEL 10.73866MHz crystal |
| C1, C2 | 16pf ceramic or MLCC capacitor |
| C3-C11 | 0.1uf caps (bypass caps for each chip and one for the video output circuit) |
| Q1 | 2N4401 NPN transistor. Any NPN with similar characteristics should work. |
| J1 | 40 pin right angle header |
| J2 | KLPX-0848A-2-Y RCA connector. Other models may not fit.  |
| J3 | UNUSED - these holes are used for the wide version of U8 |
| J4 | 2x8 pin straight header and 1 jumper block |

Aside from the board and the TMS9918A itself, all parts are available from Mouser and probably other suppliers as well.

## Address Configuration Jumper

The jumper above the 74HCT138 selects the ports that the TMS9918A is mapped to. From left to right, the jumper will assign the TMS9918A's RAM and Register ports, respectively, to the following addresses:

- 08/09
- 18/19
- 48/49
- 58/59
- 88/89
- 98/99 (recommended for MSX compatibility)
- C8/C9
- D8/D9
